        <h1>Art Movements</h1>
        <h2>Cubism</h2>
        <p>
            A work of art in which perspective with a single viewpoint was abandoned and use was made of simple geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and, later, collage. Cubism was a reaction against traditional modes of representation and impressionist concerns with light and colour.
            <br>
            <br> Cubism began between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism. The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially František Kupka accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely.

        <h2>Expressionism</h2>
        <p>
            Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express meaning or emotional experience rather than physical reality.

        <h2>Geometric Abstraction</h2>
        <p>
            Geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, placed in non-illusionistic space and combined into non-objective compositions.
            <br>
            <br> Some 20th century modern artists turned away from representational art, or art that depicted objects in the real world, toward purified abstract forms that could not be construed to look like anything in the known world. Based on strict design principles with no attempt to create an illusion of three-dimensional space, geometric abstraction was considered by many modern artists to be the ultimate art movement. Geometric forms are specific shapes formed by straight lines or curved lines that continue along a continuous path.

        <h2>Surrealism</h2>
        <p>Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s in Paris, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. The aim was to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality." Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself.</p>

        <h2>Dadaism</h2>
        <p>Began in Zurich, Switzerland in 1916. The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.</p>

        <h2>Abstract Expressionism</h2>
        <p>It is a post World War II art movement, developed in New York in 1940s. An important predecessor is surrealism, with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it.</p>

        <h2>Claude Monet</h2><p>
    Claude Monet was a founder of French Impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.</p>-->
