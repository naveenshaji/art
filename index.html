        <h1>Art Movements</h1>
        <h2>Cubism</h2>
        <p>
            A work of art in which perspective with a single viewpoint was abandoned and use was made of simple geometric shapes, interlocking planes, and, later, collage. Cubism was a reaction against traditional modes of representation and impressionist concerns with light and colour.
            <br>
            <br> Cubism began between 1907 and 1911. Pablo Picasso's 1907 painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon has often been considered a proto-Cubist work. By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism. The most extreme forms of Cubism were not those practiced by Picasso and Braque, who resisted total abstraction. Other Cubists, by contrast, especially Franti≈°ek Kupka accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely.

        <h2>Expressionism</h2>
        <p>
            Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express meaning or emotional experience rather than physical reality.

        <h2>Geometric Abstraction</h2>
        <p>
            Geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, placed in non-illusionistic space and combined into non-objective compositions.
            <br>
            <br> Some 20th century modern artists turned away from representational art, or art that depicted objects in the real world, toward purified abstract forms that could not be construed to look like anything in the known world. Based on strict design principles with no attempt to create an illusion of three-dimensional space, geometric abstraction was considered by many modern artists to be the ultimate art movement. Geometric forms are specific shapes formed by straight lines or curved lines that continue along a continuous path.

        <h2>Surrealism</h2>
        <p>Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. The aim was to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality." Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes with photographic precision, created strange creatures from everyday objects and developed painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express itself.</p>
